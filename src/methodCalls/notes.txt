calculator Program
	information/data = stored in MEMORY
		number 1 : 250
		number 2 : 3
		
	instruction = followed by CPU 
	multiply
		take number 1 and add it to itself "number 2" times
		250 + 250 + 250
	Hexa = 6	
0-9 = 10 possible values
A-F = 6 additional possible

JDK = Compiler + interpreter(JVM)
JRE = Interpreter(JVM)

Program
	(src)source code : human readable program
		programs with extension .java

	COMPILER= converts a source code into binary code

	(bin)binary code : Machine readable program
		programs with extension .class /.exe /.bat etc



Object oriented programming
Most closely realtable at real world
	Modular/distributed approach
	rocket
		has -a : fuel tank, exhcuation chamber, cock pit
		does : fly, land
	
Procedure oriented programming
	fly = 
	C program

Rocket
	fly
